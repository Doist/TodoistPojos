# TodoistPojos

TodoistPojos is a JVM project which provides the base POJOs (in Kotlin) for most [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/) objects.

The naming follows the same as the API, both for classes, variables and methods, with very few helper methods added.

## Usage

These models are usable out of the box. All models and their properties are open to allow subclassing and overriding.

## General considerations

### Temporary ids

Temporary ids are negative `long` values. Regular ids start at 0 and go up from there. The API supports any type of value for temporary ids, so special `String` values would also work. However, this would require an additional field to hold the temporary id, additional logic, and seems completely unecessary for most usages.

The generation of temporary ids is up to the host application, but the algorithm can be really simple: start at -1 and go down from there. An Android application could use something like the following:

```kotlin
@Synchronized
fun getNextTempId(context: Context): Long {
    val preferences = context.getSharedPreferences("todoist_temp_ids", MODE_PRIVATE)
    val id = preferences.getLong("temp_id", 0) - 1
    preferences.edit().apply {
        if (id > Long.MIN_VALUE) {
            // Save decremented temp id.
            putLong("temp_id", id)
        } else {
            // Restart from -1 in next call.
            remove("temp_id")
        }
        apply()
    }
    
    return id
}
```
